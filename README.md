# SourceSherpa

A modular backend for extracting, storing, and serving source code context for LLM/RAG workflows.

### 🗄️ Multi-Stage, Pluggable Storage & Retrieval

SourceSherpa supports **multi-stage question answering**, where each stage of the workflow can use the most appropriate storage or retrieval mechanism for the task.

#### **Stage 1: Top-Level Feature Index (MongoDB)**
- Provides a “table of contents” for the codebase.
- Powers broad, project-level questions:
  - “What kinds of files/features/domains exist?”
  - “How many web pages/controllers/services are there?”
- Data is indexed as feature blocks, stored in MongoDB for fast, flexible lookups.

#### **Stage 2: Semantic & Deep Code Retrieval (Qdrant + Embeddings)**
- Handles detailed, code-specific queries:
  - “What are all the fields in the Device domain?”
  - “How is authentication handled across projects?”
- Uses Qdrant as a vector store, enabling semantic/code similarity via embeddings (e.g., CodeBERT, MiniLM).

#### **Design Pattern: Pluggable Storage Modules**
- Each backend (Mongo, Qdrant, others) is a self-contained module under `src/storage/`.
- The API (MCP) layer routes queries to one or more storage backends depending on the question’s stage and specificity.
- Supports easy expansion: add new storage or retrieval mechanisms without breaking the workflow.

#### **Example Flow**
1. **Initial question:** “What does this project do?”
   - Answered using features index in Mongo.
2. **Follow-up:** “Tell me more about the device domain.”
   - Answered using semantic search from Qdrant.
3. **Deeper query:** “Show me methods for device validation.”
   - Answered via additional indexing, code embeddings, or chunk-level search.

**This modular, stage-aware design supports broad discovery, detailed exploration, and future extensibility as your code and data needs grow.**

# SourceSherpa
📦 Project Structure & Responsibilities

This repo is organized so you can extract, store, and serve code context blocks for LLMs and agent workflows—modularly and language-agnostically.

Folder Breakdown
	•	src/context/
Defines the schema and handling for “context blocks”—the core unit of knowledge exchanged and stored.
Contains the ContextBlock class for code features, file snippets, and metadata.
	•	src/extractors/
Logic for parsing codebases and extracting features.
Extractors use patterns to find relevant files or code elements (e.g., controllers, services), and create ContextBlocks.
	•	src/patterns/
Reusable language/framework-specific matching patterns.
For example: “find all *Controller.cs files in a .NET repo,” or “look for React components.”
Patterns are used by extractors to guide what to pull out of codebases.
	•	src/storage/
Handles reading/writing context blocks to persistent storage.
Supports different backends (MongoDB, Qdrant, etc.) so you can plug in whatever’s best for your retrieval needs.
	•	src/api/
Implements the MCP (Model Context Protocol): the API endpoint that agents and LLMs call to get context blocks.
When an agent asks a question, the API queries storage/ for matching blocks and returns them in the format defined by context/.

### 🛠 Code Feature Extraction Workflow

This module extracts and categorizes source code files using project-specific patterns. It creates a single canonical JSON output (example: `features_and_patterns.json`) that maps code files to their detected roles (controllers, services, models, etc.), ready for use in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) or agent workflows.

#### **How it works:**
1. **Pattern Loading**:  
   Reads code patterns from the patterns collection in MongoDB (e.g., globs like `Controllers/*Controller.cs`).
2. **File Scanning**:  
   Scans the output directory for code files or AST outputs from multiple repositories.
3. **Categorization**:  
   Matches each file to patterns and assigns a role/group (e.g., "Controller", "Validator", "Service").
4. **Output**:  
   Writes a flattened JSON array, with each entry containing:
   - `repo`: Repository name
   - `program`: Program/grouping identifier
   - `group`: Role/category (from matched pattern)
   - `value`: Path to the code file
   - `matched_pattern`: Which glob/pattern matched
   - `notes`: Free-text notes about the group
   - `source_file`: Originating file (if coming from AST)

**Example output:**

```json
{ 
  "repo": "repo name",
  "program": "broader solution",
  "group": "Controller",
  "value": "/path/to/Controllers/UserController.cs",
  "matched_pattern": "Controllers/*Controller.cs",
  "notes": "ASP.NET MVC & Web-API controllers",
  "source_file": "UserController.cs.json"
}

## 🧩 **How This Fits**

- **Input:** AST-extracted or raw code filepaths, plus patterns from Mongo.
- **Process:** Script matches files to roles using glob patterns and heuristics.
- **Output:** JSON array (like [your uploaded file](sandbox:/mnt/data/features_and_patterns.json?_chatgptios_conversationID=684452c5-ee44-800f-8a46-4efb49dd4eeb&_chatgptios_messageID=4af3ee18-6f28-42f9-b5e7-3b55537cfb22)) for each code feature.
- **Next step:** Load this into Mongo, serve via your API.

### 📁 Generated Content

All intermediate outputs and artifacts (AST files, feature lists, etc.) are written to the `generated/` directory at the repo root.

This directory is git-ignored by default (`generated/` in `.gitignore`).

**Example feature loader usage:**
```bash
python src/storage/feature_loader.py --input generated/ast_output/features_and_patterns.json

### 🔄 Loading Patterns and Features

To load or refresh patterns (for file categorization):

```bash
python src/storage/pattern_loader.py
